# System-Design Playground

This repository gathers lightweight, production-oriented design docs I use for practice and interviews.  
Each sub-directory contains a self-contained system with its own artefacts (architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, database designs, etc.).

| System | Description | Docs |
|--------|-------------|------|
| URL Shortener | Converts long URLs into compact, trackable aliases with quotas, rate-limits and admin controls. | [`Link`](url-shortener/README.md) |
| Book Reader| A web platform where admins upload books and readers browse, search, rate, and read them via a single monthly subscription. | [`Link`](book-reader/README.md) |
